Updates to Site:
- Removed annoying moving "Choose Me!" element at footer of page
- Added 'Other' section below projects section
- Added U.S. Bank Cal Hi sports inspirational athlete of the week video to the 'Other' section at the bottom of the page. Utilized Youtube Iframe API to embed youtube video
- 'Contact Me!' Page (contact.html)
    - Added link to page in navbar and hamburger bar
    - Created & styled header for contact.html
    - Updated the links in the header to allow navigation back to Home
    - Added Contact Icons
    - TODO: Style and format icons

Adding 3rd Party Script:
- I utilized the Youtube Iframe API in order to embed a Youtube video into my 
project. The script for this is located both at the bottom of index.html & in youtubePlayer.js and main.js
- Why? I added this because I want to be able to showcase youtube videos that are applicable to my portfolio webpage in a streamless fashion. In the future I can add youtube videos that are related to the projects that I am doing, as well.
